        <h1> Favorite Movie</h1>
        <h2> "Twilight",</h2> 
   <i>Ever since I was young I have loved wathcing movies. My all time favotite movie is "Twilight"! Twilight is the story of two star crossed lovers who desperately wanted to be together, but because of their circumstances, it being that Edward, the male love interest, is a vampire, and Bella, the female love interest, is human, they cannot be together. I love their story so much because it is a story of love, pain and passion. No matter what Edward fought for Bella and vice versa and that is what I want in my future marriage/relationship. I want someone to fight so hard for me and be dangerously in love with me.</i>
