        <h1> Favorite Movie</h1>
        <h2> "Twilight",</h2> 
   <i>Ever since I was young I have loved wathcing movies. My all time favotite movie is<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxjNDE2fMjI"> Twilight</a> Twilight is the story of two star crossed lovers who desperately wanted to be together, but because of their circumstances, it being that Edward, the male love interest, is a vampire, and Bella, the female love interest, is human, they cannot be together. I love their story so much because it is a story of love, pain and passion. No matter what Edward fought for Bella and vice versa and that is what I want in my future marriage/relationship. I want someone to fight so hard for me and be dangerously in love with me.</i>
