        <h1> Favorite Song</h1>
        <h2> "Drake, "Not You Too",</h2> 
   <i>I love music. Music is another one of my passions that I used to escape the real world. My favorite song is called "Not You Too" by Aubrey Graham formally known as "Drake". This song is about a man, who everybody has mistreated and done wrong, and the one person who he thought he could count on did him wrong as well. It's a sad story about betrayal, love and how no matter how much you love someone, it does not mean they love you the same. I feel like I can relate to this song so much, because I have been wronged so many times by people who I would have died for. And in the end it's like how I feel doesnt even matter. So I can relate to the sadness and jadedness of this song as it represents my life and many of my tragic love stories.</i>
